## CURRENTLY ON DEVELOPMENT

This repo contains the code for a final project for my current development school.

It's a simple app that allow the user to:

- Search for Pokemon using the PokeAPI
- Create a new Pokemon with simple template and download them as a card

> This project has the sole intention of learning. All rights to the Pokemon trademark belong to their owners and this code has no relation to them.
