# Pokedocs

Welcome to PokeDocs!
This is a web app for my final project at school.
It's designed to allow the user to:
- Search for a Pokemon and retrive basic informations thanks to the PokeAPI.
- Create custom Pokemons thanks to a dynamic template.
- Allowing the user to search throught It's collections and download them as an image for sharing.
